## Project Description and Methodology
The following project analyses House Sales data taken from King County between 2014-2015. The main objective
is to predict the house pricing based on several given features to so give recommendations to potential home sellers and buyers.
The methodology covers all steps of a [DATA SCIENCE LIFE CYCLE](https://www.educba.com/data-science-lifecycle/) in order to achieve the objective. The applied model for prediction is conducted by means of multinear regression.

## Findings:
The Key Features which influence the house price are:
  - Square foot of the living area
  - Waterfront Houses
  - Condition and Grade
 
The model prediction was enhanced via:
  - Reducing the skewness using the log transformation of the label (price)
  - Scaling of the Data
  - Applying dummy variables for the categorical features
